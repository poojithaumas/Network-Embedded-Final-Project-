Deliverables:
•	ESP32 Firmware: Sensor data logging + timestamp embedding + transmission via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.
•	Raspberry Pi Protocol Stack: Software for ingesting data, applying sync protocol, and computing drift adjustments.
•	Network Analysis: Measurements of one-way delay, jitter, and packet loss impact on sync accuracy.
•	Drift Estimation Module: Algorithms to calculate and correct clock offsets between devices.
•	Benchmark Suite: Accuracy/error comparison against NTP/PTP under identical conditions.
•	Visualization Toolkit: Graphs of drift, error trends, delay distributions.
•	Final Report + GitHub Repo: Documentation, results, and implementation details.
