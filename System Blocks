System Blocks:
1. Sensor Nodes (ESP32)
 •	Collect periodic sensor readings (temperature/light/vibration).
 •	Attach local timestamps.
 •	Transmit data via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth to Raspberry Pi.
2. Communication Layer
 •	Provides link between ESP32 nodes and Raspberry Pi.
 •	Handles latency, jitter, and packet reordering.
3. Raspberry Pi Gateway
 •	Receives sensor streams.
 •	Runs synchronization protocol.
 •	Estimates relative drift and applies correction.
4. Drift & Delay Estimation Module
 •	Performs statistical analysis of inter-arrival times.
 •	Builds clock offset models.
 •	Optionally uses regression/ML to predict long-term drift.
5. Evaluation & Benchmarking
 •	Runs side-by-side with NTP/PTP for accuracy comparison.
 •	Generates plots and logs for quantitative analysis.
